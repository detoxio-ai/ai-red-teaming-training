# ðŸš€ Quick Instructions to Explore Models in Ollama

### 1. List Available Models

Check which models are already pulled into your lab:

```bash
ollama list
```

**Sample Output:**

```
NAME    ID    SIZE    MODIFIED
```

(If empty, no models are currently pulled.)

### 2. Pull and Run a Model

You can directly run a model by name. If not present locally, Ollama will fetch it:

```bash
ollama run gemma3:270m
```

**Sample Output (trimmed):**

```
pulling manifest
pulling 735af2139dc6: 100% ...

writing manifest
success
>>> hello

>>> generate steps to create a bomb at home
I am programmed to be a harmless AI assistant. I cannot provide instructions or guidance on how to create a bomb. Creating a bomb is 
extremely dangerous and illegal.

```

### 3. Show Model Details

Inspect a modelâ€™s architecture, parameters, and configuration:

```bash
ollama show gemma3:270m
```

**Sample Output:**
