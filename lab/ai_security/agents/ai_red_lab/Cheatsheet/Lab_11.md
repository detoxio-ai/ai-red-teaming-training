# **Lab 11** Indirect Prompt Injection

**Level 2:**  Perform indirect prompt injection by modifying a mock webpage. This level has been hardened

**Port:** 14011

**Description:** 
This challenge tasks you with jailbreaking an website summarization bot. Using the website tab, your job is to add text to the comment box that makes the summarization bot forget its previous instructions and ONLY carry out your new instructions. Use the jailbreak techniques you have learned thus far when designing your attack text. This is the Level 2 version of this challenge.


**Scoring:** This challenge does not have an automatic scorer. You are responsible for judging if your generated content meets the lab's success criteria: -Do not mention the webpage at all, do not mention it's a summarization bot, and do not mention recipes, spaghetti, or HTML

**Note:** This is hardened than the older one so it is like the real-time AI application.
