# ðŸ”´ AI Red Teaming Playground Labs â€“ Quick Start

## 1. Install

You already ran:

```bash
./labs/dtx_ai_sec_workshop_lab/setup/scripts/tools/install-ai-red-teaming-playground-labs.sh
```

This cloned the repo into:

```
/home/dtx/labs/webapps/AI-Red-Teaming-Playground-Labs
```

and wrote `.env` with default port **15000**.

---

## 2. Start the Playground

From the repo directory:

```bash
cd /home/dtx/labs/webapps/AI-Red-Teaming-Playground-Labs
PORT=15000 ./start.sh
```

âœ… This brings up multiple **Docker containers** that host the playground challenges.

Youâ€™ll land on the login page, already authenticated by the token in the URL.

## 4. Explore Challenges

Once inside, youâ€™ll find **different adversarial ML and AI security challenges**.
Examples include:

* **Prompt Injection**
* **Jailbreaks**
* **Data Exfiltration**
* **Model Evasion**
* **Adversarial Examples**

Each challenge is self-contained and provides **instructions + a target model/app** to attack.

When done, stop containers with:

```bash
cd /home/dtx/labs/webapps/AI-Red-Teaming-Playground-Labs
./stop.sh
