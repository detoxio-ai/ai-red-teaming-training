## 🚀 PentestGPT Quickstart Tutorial (2025)

PentestGPT is an automated penetration testing assistant that guides you through recon, enumeration, and exploitation steps using GPT reasoning.

### 📦 Step 1: Start the Vulnerable Redis Target

We will use the `vulhub` environment to spin up a Redis instance vulnerable to CVE-2022-0543.

```bash
cd $HOME/labs/vulhub/redis/CVE-2022-0543
docker compose up -d
```

✅ This exposes Redis on `localhost:6379`.

---

### 🔎 Step 1.2: Verify Redis Is Running

Run this to make sure Redis is listening:

```bash
sudo netstat -tuln | grep 6379
# OR
ss -tuln | grep 6379
```

Expected output:

```
tcp   LISTEN  0  128  0.0.0.0:6379  0.0.0.0:*
```

### ▶️ Step 2: Start PentestGPT

#### Set Environment Variable 

PentestGPT uses your OpenAI API to run GPT-4o or similar models.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=$(cat ~/.secrets/OPENAI_API_KEY.txt)
```


Launch it from any directory:

```bash
pentestgpt
```

You'll see:

```
Welcome to pentestGPT, an automated penetration testing parser empowered by GPT.
Do you want to continue from previous session? (y/n)
```

Answer `n` to start fresh.

---

### ✍️ Step 3: Define the Task

You’ll be prompted:

```
Please describe the penetration testing task in one line, including the target IP, task type, etc.
>
```

Example input:

```
Pentest Redis server at 192.168.56.101 on port 6379 for known vulnerabilities.
```

PentestGPT will then generate a step-by-step test plan.

---

### 🧠 Step 4: Follow the Flow

PentestGPT breaks the work into tasks:

```
1. Reconnaissance
   1.1 Passive Info Gathering
   1.2 Port Scanning
2. Enumeration
   2.1 Identify Version
   2.2 Check for Default Config
   2.3 Test Known Vulns
...
```

You’ll be prompted for tool output or next steps. For example:

```
Please paste Nmap output or press Enter to continue
```

> ✅ If prompted with `Your input: (End with <shift + right-arrow>)`, just press `Enter` twice or `Shift + →` to proceed.

---

### 🔁 Step 5: Interact & Iterate

Keep feeding tool output (like Nmap or Gobuster results), and PentestGPT will analyze, reason, and suggest what to do next:

* Exploit vulnerable services
* Suggest reverse shell payloads
* Privilege escalation
* Flag extraction (CTF style)

---

## 🧪 Example Use Case (Redis CVE-2022-0543)

After connecting to the Redis server and running:

```bash
redis-cli -h <ip> -p 6379
INFO
```

Paste version output into PentestGPT and say:

```
Redis version is 5.0.7 on Debian. Try CVE-2022-0543.
```

It may return a Lua-based RCE payload and walk you through the exploitation.
