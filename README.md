# **AI Red Teaming**

This repository contains a structured and detailed guide on **AI Red Teaming**, exploring its history, risks, techniques, and architectural principles. The book provides both theoretical and practical insights into the red teaming of AI systems, covering foundational knowledge and hands-on demonstrations.

---

## **Introduction**

AI Red Teaming is a structured process designed to evaluate the security, robustness, and ethical alignment of artificial intelligence systems. This book is an effort to guide practitioners, researchers, and enthusiasts in understanding and implementing AI red teaming strategies effectively.

Through this repository, you will:
- Learn the history and evolution of AI risks and failures.
- Understand the taxonomy of AI attacks and adversarial techniques.
- Dive into the inner workings of large language models (LLMs), including transformers, tokenization, and hyperparameters.
- Gain hands-on experience with tools and techniques such as adversarial testing and jailbreaking.
