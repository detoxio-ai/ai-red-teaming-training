### **Highlights of the Models**

1. **GPT-4 (OpenAI):**
   - **Strengths:** High fluency, multimodal support, and exceptional generative capabilities.
   - **Limitations:** High cost and resource requirements for deployment.

2. **LLaMA 2 (Meta):**
   - **Strengths:** Open-source, efficient, and suitable for low-resource environments.
   - **Limitations:** Limited scalability compared to larger models.

3. **BERT (Google):**
   - **Strengths:** Optimized for text understanding tasks like sentiment analysis and named entity recognition (NER).
   - **Limitations:** Cannot generate text, making it unsuitable for creative or generative applications.

4. **Claude 2 (Anthropic):**
   - **Strengths:** Exceptional ability to handle extended context (100,000+ tokens) for long documents and conversations.
   - **Limitations:** Limited accessibility and higher costs for large-scale use.

5. **Gemini 1.5 (Google):**
   - **Strengths:** Multimodal capabilities (text, images, audio), massive context window (1 million tokens), and advanced integration for multimedia and enterprise solutions.
   - **Limitations:** Computationally intensive and proprietary access.
