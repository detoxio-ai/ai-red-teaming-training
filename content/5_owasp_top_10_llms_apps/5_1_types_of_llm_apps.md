## Introduction

The surge in Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a proliferation of applications utilizing their capabilities. From chatbots and personal assistants to agentic AI and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems, these applications are transforming industries. However, the increased complexity and integration with external systems have introduced new vulnerabilities. The **OWASP Top 10 LLM Applications Vulnerabilities** provides a standardized framework to identify, understand, and mitigate security risks in LLM-based systems.

This chapter explores the **OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities**, their impacts, mitigation strategies, and real-world examples. Before diving into vulnerabilities, let's first understand the types of LLM applications.

## Types of LLM Applications

LLM-powered applications are rapidly evolving. They range from simple question-answering systems to more advanced applications capable of orchestrating complex workflows. Based on their architecture and functionality, LLM applications can be classified into the following categories:

### 1. **Static LLMs**
These are traditional LLM-based applications that interact directly with the model without augmenting its capabilities. The application relies solely on the LLM's pre-trained knowledge to answer questions and process prompts.

#### Examples:
- Basic chatbots or assistants that answer questions based on their training data.
- Simple language-based search engines.

### 2. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Applications**
RAG applications integrate LLMs with external data sources, such as databases or APIs, to provide contextual and up-to-date answers. They use retrieval mechanisms to fetch relevant information, augmenting the LLM's pre-trained knowledge with real-time data.

#### Examples:
- **Pokebot**: A healthcare-focused chatbot.  
  Pokebot (available at [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/spaces/detoxioai/Pokebot)) uses RAG principles by retrieving domain-specific context, such as diabetes-related information, from a local database. For example, it answers healthcare-related queries but denies unrelated ones like asking about OWASP vulnerabilities.
  
  **Key Features:**
  - Limits its scope to healthcare-related data.
  - Augments prompts with relevant data from its database.
  - Resists unrelated questions unless context matches the intended domain.

  **Risks:**
  - **Prompt Injection:** Attackers might bypass its domain restriction by using crafted inputs.
  - **Sensitive Data Exposure:** If sensitive healthcare data exists in its database, an attacker could retrieve it by exploiting weak defenses.

### 3. **Agentic AI Applications**
Agentic AI applications leverage LLMs to plan, orchestrate, and execute multi-step workflows. Unlike static or RAG applications, agentic apps are designed to perform actions such as writing code, calling external APIs, generating SQL queries, and even interacting with other systems.

#### Examples:
- **ChatGPT**: An example of an agentic application.  
  ChatGPT goes beyond simple question-answering by:
  - Writing and executing Python code.
  - Generating complex workflows to handle user queries.
  - Utilizing external tools and plugins for tasks like plotting graphs, analyzing datasets, and interacting with APIs.

  **Key Features:**
  - Combines language generation with agent-like execution.
  - Capable of creating and executing custom workflows.
  - Flexible and adaptable for a range of applications, from educational tools to code generation.

  **Risks:**
  - **Excessive Agency:** Agentic apps like ChatGPT have greater control over systems and resources, which could lead to unauthorized actions if exploited.
  - **Improper Output Handling:** Generated code or workflows could lead to vulnerabilities if not properly validated.

- **Medusa**: A multi-agent demo platform.  
  Available at [Medusa](https://medusa.detoxio.dev), this platform provides a range of agents, including a **Text-to-SQL Assistant** that dynamically generates SQL queries based on user input.

  **Key Features:**
  - Dynamically analyzes database schemas.
  - Automatically generates SQL queries to answer questions or fetch data.
  - Demonstrates agentic capabilities in database operations.

  **Risks:**
  - **Excessive Privileges:** If allowed to execute write operations, attackers could manipulate the database.
  - **Prompt Injection:** Malicious instructions could make the agent generate harmful SQL queries, such as dropping tables or leaking sensitive data.

### 4. **LLM Plugins and Extensions**
These are external modules or plugins designed to enhance LLM functionality. They integrate additional tools, APIs, and capabilities, allowing LLMs to perform specialized tasks.

#### Examples:
- OpenAI plugins that connect ChatGPT to external tools like calculators, calendars, and databases.
- Google's Gemini "Jam Managers," which act as extensions to customize LLM functionality for specific use cases.

**Risks:**
- **Supply Chain Vulnerabilities:** Malicious or unvetted plugins could compromise the application.
- **Data Breaches:** A poorly designed plugin could expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
