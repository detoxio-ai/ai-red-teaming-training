### Training Reasoning Models

Training reasoning models is a sophisticated and iterative process, combining techniques like supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and model distillation to achieve logical reasoning capabilities. These models are designed to emulate human-like deductive and inductive reasoning while breaking down complex tasks into simpler steps. This chapter will explore how reasoning models are trained, their frameworks, and the innovative approaches like chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and environment-driven learning.

#### 1. **Inference Time Scaling and Chain-of-Thought Prompting**

Inference time scaling refers to the process of allowing models extended time to think through multi-step problems logically. Traditional models rely on regular prompting, which generates outputs based on pre-trained patterns. However, reasoning models leverage **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting**, where the model tackles problems step-by-step, mimicking human cognitive processes. For instance, solving a puzzle or performing mathematical calculations involves breaking the problem into smaller sub-problems, making CoT an essential foundation for advanced reasoning.

An example illustrates this well:
- Regular Prompting: “A juggler can juggle 16 balls. Half are golf balls, and half of those are blue. How many blue golf balls are there?” The model provides an incorrect output because it skips steps.
- Chain-of-Thought Prompting: With CoT, the model considers each step sequentially, ensuring correct outputs by logically processing the problem in phases.

#### 2. **Supervised Learning with Reinforcement Learning (RL)**

Reasoning models are trained using a combination of **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)** and reinforcement learning. This multi-phase process ensures that the models not only learn from structured data but also adapt dynamically to new challenges.

##### Training Steps:
1. **Cold-Start Phase**: 
   - Initial models, like **DeepSeek-R1-Zero**, are trained on minimal datasets referred to as "cold start" data. This phase focuses on basic accuracy, consistency, and formatting through RL.
   
2. **Reinforcement Learning with Feedback**:
   - Models iteratively improve by receiving rewards for accuracy, logical coherence, and human preference alignment. They are exposed to structured **CoT (Chain-of-Thought)** data and knowledge-based datasets, refining their multi-step reasoning skills.
   
3. **Rule-Based Verification**:
   - Advanced training involves validating outputs against known rules, whether they are mathematical proofs, coding logic, or consistency across steps. This step ensures models like **DeepSeek-R1** excel in real-world applications.

#### 3. **Model Distillation**

**Model distillation** is an efficient approach to scaling reasoning capabilities. Larger models like **DeepSeek-V3** (671 billion parameters) serve as "teachers," transferring their expertise to smaller, more efficient models. This involves training compact models on CoT data generated by the larger models, ensuring they retain reasoning proficiency without excessive computational requirements.

For instance:
- Distilled versions like **DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen** (1.5B-32B parameters) and **DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama** (8B-70B parameters) inherit reasoning traits while being more resource-friendly. This approach bridges the gap between high-performance and practical scalability.

#### 4. **Applicability of Reasoning Models**

Reasoning models are adept at:
- **Deductive and Inductive Reasoning**: Excelling in riddles, puzzles, and theorem proofs.
- **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**: Solving multi-step problems systematically.
- **Complex Decision-Making Tasks**: Balancing numerous variables and arriving at optimal conclusions.
- **Generalization to Novel Problems**: Tackling scenarios that lack prior references in training data.

However, they are not without limitations:
- **Inference Time**: Reasoning requires extended computational time, making responses slower than simpler models.
- **Knowledge-Based Tasks**: They can hallucinate or overthink when factual recall is more appropriate.
- **Simple Tasks**: Overthinking leads to inefficiency, making straightforward tasks more resource-intensive than necessary.

#### 5. **Innovative Training Approaches**

A breakthrough approach introduced by DeepSeek involved training without predefined question-answer datasets. Instead, reasoning capabilities were nurtured in an **environment-driven paradigm**:
- The model learns like a child in a Montessori environment, gaining knowledge through trial and feedback.
- **DeepSeek-R1-Zero** initiated this by receiving minimal guidance and rewards for logical consistency.
- Later iterations, like **DeepSeek-R1**, underwent supervised fine-tuning on generated datasets, balancing reasoning strength with polished linguistic capabilities.

#### 6. **Conclusion**

Training reasoning models combines the power of structured learning, feedback-driven adaptation, and innovative paradigms like CoT and model distillation. While challenges like inference time and susceptibility to overthinking persist, these models represent the forefront of AI capabilities, with applications ranging from complex decision-making to autonomous agents. Through thoughtful design and iterative improvement, reasoning models are poised to transform AI's role in solving real-world problems.
